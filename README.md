# Portfolio

## Description 

This project was created to showcase my future work to potential clients or employers. The About page showcases some basic information about me along with a picture of myself.
The portfolio page will eventually link to my individual applications.  The Contact page will eventually be linked to allow others to communicate with me.
This project is important for my success in the coding industry. It is both a reflection of myself and of my abilities as a coder.

The main challenge in this project was getting the positioning correct for the navigation bar and the portfolio pictures. In the future, the navigation bar will be replaced by a Bootstrap navigation bar.


## Installation

To utilize the project, open in your internet browser.


## Usage 

The project provides the framework for a future portfolio. It provides the user information about myself and will eventually showcase my applications and allow the user to message me through the contact page.
