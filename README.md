# Portfolio

## Description 

This project was created to showcase my future work to potential clients or employers. The About page showcases some basic information about me along with a picture of myself.
The portfolio page will eventually link to my individual applications.  The Contact page will eventually be linked to allow others to communicate with me.
This project is important for my success in the coding industry. It is both a reflection of myself and of my abilities as a coder.

The portfolio has further been edited using Bootstrap to create a layout that is mobile responsive. The navigation bar and the sticky footer were changed to include Bootstrap as well.
Honestly, the biggest challenge that I faced in this project was simply changing the font color of my name from black to white. 
I ended up creating an id to change the font color. After trying class after class and using the chrome inspector, I could not find the class that allowed for me to change the font color.


## Installation

To utilize the project, open in your internet browser.


## Usage 

The project provides the framework for a future portfolio. It provides the user information about myself and will eventually showcase my applications and allow the user to message me through the contact page.
